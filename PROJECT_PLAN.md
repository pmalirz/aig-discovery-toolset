## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-19 | Approach C: Document-first + agent analysis | Combines Markdown simplicity for data entry with AI-powered analysis. No web UI needed for V1. |
| 2026-04-19 | Tracker organized by pillars, not company name | Single repo per engagement; company has multiple entities, pillars, and teams — pillars are the natural grouping. |
| 2026-04-19 | Use the existing 6-dimension scoring framework | Use the 6 well-defined dimensions and weighted scoring — no need to reinvent. |
| 2026-04-19 | Agent skills built on skills.sh | Aligns with existing tooling in the repository; skills are portable and version-controlled. |
